# Exam-booking-BOT-for-Statens-Vegvesen-
A script that monitors the first available examination date with notifications in Telegram

## Background
Statens vegvesen is a norwegian institution that is responsible for roads, vehicle regulations and driver licencing. The latter will be the main focus of this project.
To obtain a driver licence, one must go thorough numerous mandatory driving hours, theory, and, of course, practical driving test. This final test (or exam if you wish) one must book via Statens Vegvesen's web page which unfortunately does not always offer that many spots available. In most of the times, there are no available dates to book and the only way to get an empty spot is to simply wait until someone else cancels his/her appointment so you can jump in.

The main advice from teachers in traffic schools is to refresh the Statens Vegvesen's examination page around 1000 time per day, and jump in to the time slot when available.
